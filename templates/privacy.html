  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: {{ year }}</strong></p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Online Screen Recorder ("Service") is designed to be private and secure.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not require user accounts, and we aim to collect as little information as possible. The information we handle includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Video Recordings:</strong> The screen recordings you create are uploaded to our servers. These files are associated with a randomly generated, anonymous session token stored in your browser's cookies. They are not linked to any personal identity unless you choose to share them.</li>
    <li><strong>Session Token:</strong> We use a cookie ("magic_token") to anonymously identify your browser session so you can access your list of recordings on a return visit.</li>
    <li><strong>Email Address (Optional):</strong> If you use the "Email" feature, we use your provided email address solely for the purpose of sending you the specified recording link. We do not store, sell, or use this email address for any other purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>Your data is used exclusively to provide the Service's functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To store and serve your recordings back to you.</li>
    <li>To allow you to create shareable links.</li>
    <li>To send a recording link to an email address at your request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
  <p>Your recordings are stored on our secure cloud infrastructure. You have full control over your data. You can delete individual recordings at any time using the "Delete" button, or you can erase your entire session history using the "Forget My Session" button. Forgetting a session deletes the cookie from your browser and removes the server-side record of your associated files.</p>
  <p><em>(Note: Files themselves are not deleted when a session is forgotten, only the link between your browser and the files. You must delete files individually.)</em></p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use Render.com for hosting and may use other standard services for infrastructure. We do not share your recordings or personal information with any third-party advertisers.</p>
  
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">contact us</a>.</p>
